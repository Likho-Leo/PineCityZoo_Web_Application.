                                        <p>
                                                The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south central China. 
                                                It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. 
                                                The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. 
                                                Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. 
                                                Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. 
                                                In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.

                                        <p>
                                                The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighbouring provinces, namely Shaanxi and Gansu.
                                                As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.

                                        <p>
                                               The giant panda is a conservation reliant endangered species.
