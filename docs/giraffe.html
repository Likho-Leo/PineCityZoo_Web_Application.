                                    <h3><b>GIRAFFE</b></h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. 
                                        Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and its leopard-like colouring. 
                                        Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. 
                                        It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. 
                                        The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. 
                                        Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.

                                        Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.
